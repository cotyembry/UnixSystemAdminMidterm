# Exercise 1: Write a shell script in a file named Exercise1 to print the calendar for January 2017 to see what day of the week New Year's occurs on (yes, future dates can be displayed).

cal 1 2017

#Then write a for loop that prints the last 8 files in the /bin directory. 

#ls /bin | tail -n 8 #this works too but is said to be bad since its more unpredictable..?

numberOfFilesInBin=`ls /bin/ | wc`
numberOfFilesInBin="$(echo $numberOfFilesInBin | cut -d " " -f1)"

#i will help me know when I get to the last 8 files
i=0
eight=8

for file in /bin/*; do
	i=$((i + 1)) #this is an 'arithmetic expansion' - fancy name for addition
	checkFlag=$(($numberOfFilesInBin - $i))
	# if ((7 < 8)) #this is 'arithmetic context'
	if [ "$checkFlag" -lt "$eight" ]
		then
		echo $file
	fi
done

#Then the script sleeps for 4 seconds.
sleep 4

#Then write an if statement to test if file Exercise1 exists
if test -f
	then
	#if it does, display the message
	echo File Exercise1 is alive!
fi

# Then write a while loop that prints the date and time every two seconds (use the default date format).
while [[ true ]]; do
	date
	sleep 2
done

#Stop Exercise1 using control c (ctrl-c). Then run Exercise1 in the background and stop it with the ps and kill commands. Use the shell script in these lecture notes as a guide.
